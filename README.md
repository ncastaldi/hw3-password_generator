# Assignment: Password Generator

## Description 

For this assignment, we were asked to create an application that an employee could use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
